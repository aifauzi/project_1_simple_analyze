# Coffee Shop Analysis
![Coffee Shop](fresh-coffee-coffee-shop.jpg)

## Case Background
In this first project, I pretended as a *Data Analyst* in the **Coffee Shop** business and I was asked to <u>analyze</u> (a simple analyze) the sales data of previous several months back. The analyst results will be used by the Head Store <u>to see the progress</u> of the business and <u>make decisions</u> to increase sales of the store. 

## Identification of Problem
I used the SMART method to formulate the problem want to solve.

| Method | Desc |
| ----- | ----- |
| *Specific* | Increase product sales by creating product bundle promo plans based on products that are frequently ordered |
| *Measurable* | Increased 15% product sales from the previous quarter period |
| *Achievable* | Create a product bundle plan with a cheaper price than buying a single product separately |
| *Relevant* | The impact of this planning is to increase interest for new consumers and loyal consumers with more affordable prices |
| *Time-Bound* | The deadline for achieving the target of increasing 15% in product sales is 3 months |

**Problem Statement** : Create a product bundle promo plan to increase 15% of product sales within 3 months to attract consumer interest in buying products.

## Workflow
- Load and Cleaning the dataset (change the name of columns, delete a few columns, change data type, handling missing value, etc)
- Analyze and Calculate (make a visualization and doing a calculation with statistical analysis)
- Conclusion and Recommendation

## Result
File [url.txt](url.txt) contain the link of Dashboard Tableau, dataset I used, and slide presentation of the result analysis. You can see the notebook (ipynb) for the detail process analysis and the last section I explain the recommendation what can I give based on the analysis.
